# AIProjects
Simple AI projects that i worked on from scratch using C++


The first project is a puzzle solver which takes an input of a txt file with 2 3*3 puzzles the first one is
the start puzzle and the second one is the desired final outcome. the AI then uses a heuristic sum of tile distance
to find the next move and to solve the puzzle in the least amount of steps.

The second project is a 3 layer neural network that is trained to recognize handwritten digits 0-4. it uses the sigmoid activation
function and minimizes loss based on the average squared error. with a hidden layer size of 50, the network had a accuracy of 95% after 9300 epochs.
the network takes the max of 5 output neurons to find which digit that is most likely.
